# Energy forecast SoS Overview

This is the implementation of the Energy forecast system for Arrowhead, developed by:

Anders Mariegaard, Florian Lorber, & Thomas Pedersen\
Distributed, Embedded and Intelligent Systems, Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University

It predicts the required energy that a building needs from the central heating network, using historical data. Since this system (for obvious reasons) cannot access real data, two sample data providers are provided instead. These will provide the forecast with some sample data to illustrate how it works. The sample data is based on a weather data set and a couple of simple formulae to simulate the energy consumption.

The weather data set was generously provided by:
